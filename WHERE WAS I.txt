12/31 -
	used consolidated loan calculator to figure out account-level interest rate
 uses the weighted average rounded up to nearest 1/8th of a percent; may not be
 how they do it.

 changed the automatic division by 12 on user entry of interest rate.

 changed the input to the .main function to get principal and interest at the
account level rather than the individual loan level. (from wavg())



Next steps,
	find a way to confirm my account-level calculation.
	come up with a vision for final product
		FE user entry of their loans, BE logic, FE comparison/interaction
		***conceptualize a tool that allows users to input their planned payment amounts by month***
				find examples of strategy comparisons from the fed website/great lakes
	modularize the functions
	learn how to use atom(script), git, github, markdown, and everything else more effectively.

	figure out why the growth rate is so damn small; like .0001? that seems damn low
	Enable the user inputs and link them to the calculations for max_repayment duration
	test to see if it's worth optimizing the rgi finding function I've already got some ideas[1]
	write quick summary calculations for total time in repayment, total interest paid, etc...

	compute the differences by 'scenario'
	provide comparison of all options:
		long, short,
		level, stepped,
		separate, consolidated
		snowball, sniping

	maybe take into consideration expected inflation and the depreciation of your debt overtime



I copied the directory structure over from the packaging_tutorial and copied the
license and setup.py files as well. Before I publish - I need to update those.

[1]Step size = growth rate. the total number of periods,
	if present value(pv) = principal (+/- 1%):
		break #that's close enough use that growth rate and amortization schedule
	elif pv < p
		#take a step up
		growthrate += 0.001
	elif pv > principal:
		#take a half step back
		growthrate -=0.0005
